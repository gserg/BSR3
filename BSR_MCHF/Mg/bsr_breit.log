 input c-fail contains: 

 number of atomic states   =     2
 number of conf.symmetries =     2
 number of ang. symmetries =     2

 Determinant expansions: 

 ic_case, nterm, ndet           1           1           2
 ic_case, nterm, ndet           2           1           1

 Calculations for given symmetry: 

 is=     1/     2  nterm=     1  ndet=     2      0.00 sec    s( 1) d( 1)
 is=     2/     2  nterm=     1  ndet=     1      0.00 sec    p( 2)

 Results for new calculations:

 number of overlap determinants =         2       1.0
 number of overlap factors      =         4       1.2
 total number of coefficient    =        10
